What is the approximate diameter of the Milky Way in parsecs? + wn + 30000
Which Dwarf planet is closest to the Sun? + ww + ceres
An astronomer uses a telescope to observe a comet approaching the Sun. Its tails are clearly visible. 5 years later it is further from the Sun and is observed again. Explain why the tails are no longer visible. Tick all that apply. + cb + The comet is further from the Sun so Solar Wind has less effect; The Sun is at its maximum cycle do the Solar Wind is reduced; The comet lost material when it passed close to the Sun and so cannot produce as large a tail + 1;3
Describe how material from Mars could become a meteorite of Earth. Tick all that apply. + cb + A large asteroid collided with Mars in the early Solar System; The force was large enough for small rocks to escape Mars' gravity; The debris accreted and was driven towards Earth by the Solar Wind; The Earth passed through the debris and some rocks landed on the ground + 1;2;4
Explain why major moons don't exist close to large planets such a Saturn. Tick all that apply. + cb + Moons close to large planets are pulled down into the planet; Moons close to large planets are ripped apart by tidal forces; For major moons to exist, their own gravitational forces need to be stronger than the planet's tidal forces; A planet's tidal forces increase with distance + 2;3
What is the following statement describing? "The distance within which the gravity of a planet is strong enough to prevent any smaller body from being held together by gravity". + rb + The Roche Limit; The Rip Limit; The Gravitational Limit; The Tidal Limit + 1
Explain why Saturn's moon Titan has an atmosphere, while its other moon Phoebe doesn't. + rb + Titan has a spherical shape while Phoebe has an irregular shape, allowing Titan to have an atmosphere; Titan has a warmer surface temperature than Phoebe so liquids evaporate to form atmospheric gases; Titan is larger so has a larger gravitational pull to trap atmospheric gases; Titan is closer to Saturn and so can take atmospheric gases from the planet + 3
Explain why nuclear fusion occurs in the Sun's core rather than anywhere else in the star. + rb + Very high pressures and temperatures allow protons to get close together enough to fuse; Protons are only found in the Sun's core and so cannot fuse elsewhere; The Sun's core is the least dense region so there is space for nucelar fusion to occur + 1
What is the period of the Solar Sunspot Cycle to the nearest year? + wn + 11
Explain why Sunspots appear dark on the Sun's surface. Tick all that apply. + cb + The Sun rotates at different speeds; Sunspots are areas of strong magnetic fields; Sunspots have reduced convection from gases in the Sun; Sunspots are made up of 2 parts, the Umbra and the Penumbra; Sunspots radiate less than the surrounding Photosphere; Sunspots are relatively cooler regions + 2;3;5;6
How many lightyears are in a parsec (to 2 d.p.)? + ww + 3.26
