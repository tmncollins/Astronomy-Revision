The Hubble Constant is roughly 70km/s/Mpc. An galaxy is observed to be moving away from ours at a speed of 11340km/s. How far away is it to the nearest Mpc? + wn + 162
Tick all of the statements about redshift that are correct. + cb + Light from objects moving towards us is redshifted; Light from objects moving away from us is blueshifted; The universe is expanding; Most light we receive is reshifted; Most light we receive is blueshifted; The further away galaxies are, the faster they are moving; The further away galaxies are the more redshifted their light is; The further away galaxies are the more blueshifted their light is + 3;4;6;7 
The furthest objects seen are... + ww + quasar
How old is the universe in billion years (to 1 d.p.)? + ww + 13.5
A spectral line with a wavelength of 412.6nm in a lab is observed to have a wavelength of 495.1nm in the spectrum of a distant galaxy. How fast is the galaxy moving away from us in km/s (to 1 s.f.) + wn + 60000
What is the average temperature of CMB to the nearest Kelvin? + wn + 3
CMB can be seen as a faint glow at what wavelength? + rb + X-ray; UV; Visible light; IR; Microwave; Radio wave + 5
Tick all of the statements about CMB that are correct. + cb + It is an ever-permeating background radiation; It stands for Cosmic Minute Background (radiation); It was first discovered by specialist COBE probes in 1960; It was first discovered by accident by radio ECHO balloons in 1965; NASA launched COBE and WMAP probes to study it in more detail; It has a very irregular temperature + 1;4;5
Tick all of the statements about Dark Matter that are correct. + cb + It interacts weakly with other matter; It is very hard to see; It has a detectable gravitational presence; It would account for the missing mass in Spiral Galaxies; Stars far from the Galactic Nucleus orbit too slowly for the amount of matter they are observed to have; It is thought to make up 27% of the universe + 1;3;4;6
Describe the evidence for Dark Matter. Tick all that apply. + cb + The CMB radiation is uniform; The outer arms of Spiral Galaxies spin faster that they should; Gravitational Lensing + 2;3
Tick all of the statements about Dark Energy that are correct. + cb + It is a repulsive force; It is a neutral force; It causes the expansion of the universe to deccelerate; It causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate; It is thought to make up 68% of the universe + 1;4;5
What percentage of the universe is thought to be made of Normal Matter? + wn + 5
What evidence is there for the Big Bang? Tick all that apply. + cb + Dark Matter; Black Holes; CMB Radiation; We can look back in time by looking into deep space. It is very dense; Fossils on other planets + 3;4
What evidence is there for the Expanding Universe? Tick all that apply. + cb + CMB Radiation is getting hotter. This is caused by the expansion of the Universe; The vast quantities of Dark Energy discovered force the universe to expanding as Dark Energy is a repulsive force; Light from distant galaxies is redshifted. We interpret this redshift as the Doppler Effect, so the galaxies must be moving away from us + 3
Which evolutionary model for the universe is the following statement describing? "The universe will slow down in its expansion, stop, and collapse back in. When everything has been crushed into a single point, the Big Bang will occur again". + rb + The Big Crush Model; The Steady State Model; The Big Bang Model; The Empty Universe Model + 1
Which evolutionary model for the universe is the following statement describing? "The universe will continue to expand, but matter will be added to keep the density of the universe constant". + rb + The Big Crush Model; The Steady State Model; The Big Bang Model; The Empty Universe Model + 2
Which evolutionary model for the universe is the following statement describing? "The universe will continue to expand. Eventually all stars will die out and the temperature of the universe will reach an equilibrium resulting in heat death. Finally, everything will fall into blackholes". + rb + The Big Crush Model; The Steady State Model; The Big Bang Model; The Empty Universe Model + 4
