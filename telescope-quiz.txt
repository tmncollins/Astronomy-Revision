Telescopes that use lenses to focus light are called + ww + refractor
Telescopes that use parabolic mirros to focus light are called + ww + reflector
Tick all of the statements about telescopes with lenses that are correct + cb + They use 3 lenses; They use bi-concave lenses; Object and Eyepiece lenses are used; The first lens flips the image upside down + 3;4
Tick all of the statements about telescopes with mirrors that are correct + cb + Convex mirrors focus the light; The largest telescopes use mirrors; They use a secondary mirror to reflect light out of an eyepiece; Larger telescopes collect more light and so have worse resolution + 2;3
Tick all of the statements about dipoles that are correct + cb + They are used to collect radio waves; Radio waves cause electron oscillation within the dipole; Resolution of radio maps is very good; A radio dish is used to focus radio waves at the dipole; Small dishes are needed to collect data for radio astronomy + 1;2;4
How do radio astronomers mimic a large radio dish? + rb + Build a small dish on top of a mountain; Rotating small dishes; Using the Earth's rotation to orbit a small dish around another small dish; Orbiting small dishes around the Earth in space + 3
