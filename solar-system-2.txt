State Kepler's 1st Law of Planetary Motion. + rb + Each planet revolves around the Sun with the Sun at one focus and the other is empty; The force of a planet is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration; As a planet revolves around the Sun, the radius vector sweeps out equal areas at equal times; If a planet is moving fast enough, it can overcome and escape the gravitational influence of its star + 1
State Kepler's 2nd Law of Planetary Motion. + rb + Each planet revolves around the Sun with the Sun at one focus and the other is empty; The force of a planet is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration; As a planet revolves around the Sun, the radius vector sweeps out equal areas at equal times; If a planet is moving fast enough, it can overcome and escape the gravitational influence of its star + 3

Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion were derived from whose observations of Mars? + ww + tycho
When Galileo first observed the moons of Jupiter he thought that they were attached to the planet by springs. Explain why he thought this. + rb + He observed fuzzy grey coils between the moons and Jupiter. He though that these were giant springs, but in fact they were dust clouds; As the moons orbited Jupiter, they sped up when they were closer and then slowed down when they were further away. This is the same motion they would make if they were attached by springs; The orbital plane of Jupiter's moons is edge on to the Earth, so the moons appear to make a reciprocating motion, the same motion they would make if they were attached by springs + 3
