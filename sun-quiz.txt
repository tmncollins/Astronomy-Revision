What is the rotation period of the Sun at the equator in days? + wn + 25
Tick all of the statements about Sunspots that are correct. + cb + The differential rotation of the Sun builds up strong magnetic field lines; Convection twists these lines; Radiation increases the strength of these lines; Strong local fields burst through the photosphere; 2 Sunspots are created and they are oppositely charged; 2 Sunspots are formed. They are both positively charged + 1;2;4;5

What is the following statement describing? "When the Sun is at this point, the length of day and night are equal" + rb + Solstice; Conjunction; Opposition; Equinox + 4
The Solar Day is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the Meridian. How long is this in hours? + wn + 24
The Sidereal Day is shorter than the Solar Day. By how many seconds is it shorter? + wn + 236
What is the following statement describing? "The length of time it takes for the background stars to return to the Meridian" + rb + Sidereal Day; Star Day; Astronomical Day; Universal Day + 1
Explain why the Sidereal Day is shorter than the Solar Day + rb + The stars move faster than the Sun, thus it takes 4 extra minutes for the Sun to return to the Meridian; After a rotation of the Earth, the Sun has moved 1° East along the Ecliptic, meaning it takes another 4 minutes for the Sun to return to the Meridian; As the Earth rotates, the Sun also rotates, though slower. It takes 4 minutes for the Sun to rotate back round to the Meridian + 2
Tick all of the statements about the Equation of Time that are correct. + cb + The Mean Sun is used to keep time; The difference at any time between the real and Mean Suns is called the Equation of Time; The Sun appears to move at varying speeds along the ecliptic; Axial tilt is the only reason for Sun's varying speed; When the Sun moves slow, sundials read fast + 1;2;3;5
