Figure 8 shows data collected from a shadow-stick experiment. The experimenter concluded that they were at longitude 2.5°W. Evaluate the accuracy of the experiment. Tick all that apply. + img +shadow-stick-table.PNG+ cb + The shadow lengths were taken at irregular equal intervals, they should be regular; The intervals between the readings are too large to show the required detail; Not enough readings have been taken to show a trend; Readings should not have been taken before noon; The experiment was performed in Winter, it should be done in Summer; The variation in the shadow length is very small because too short a stick has been used; The estimate of the shortest shadow is imprecise; The Equation of Time has been allowed for; The student used °W when it should be °E + 2;3;6;7
