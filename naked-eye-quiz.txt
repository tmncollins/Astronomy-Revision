A student begins an observation on a cold clear moonless night in winter at midnight. Why does the student notice more stars 30 minutes later? + rb + The sky gets darker as the night progresses and the stars come out; In Winter most stars only rise after midnight, so they cannot be seen until later; Eyes adjust to the darker after time, so eyes are more sensitive to light from faint stars + 3

Explain why it is best to view Mercury when it appears to be furthest from the Sun? + rb + It would appear against a darker sky and so higher contrast + It would be a full phase and so would be at its brightest; It would be closest to the Earth in its orbit and so would appear larger + 1
Many ancient monuments are aligned with the rising and setting Sun. What were these observations used for? Tick all that apply. + cb + Masonry; Harvesting Crops; Religious Ceremonies; Calendar + 2;3;4
Why are the effects of Precession difficult to observe with the naked eye? + rb + The Earth's orbit is elliptical; Precession happens very slowly; Stars can only be observed at night; Precession can only be observed near the poles + 2
The change in the Earth's axial tilt is known as... + ww + precession
The average rate of Precession is 1.38° per century. An ancient monument was built so that its roof aligned with star X at the solstice. In The roof is now 53.4° away from star X. How long ago was the monument built to the nearest year? + wn + 3870
Explain how Precession causes a change in the Pole Star. Tick all that apply. + cb + The Earth’s axis points to the pole star; The Earth's axis points to the pole of the Ecliptic; The pole of the Ecliptic stays fixed; Precession makes the Earth’s axis circle around the pole of the ecliptic; The circle lasts 26,000 years; The pole of the Ecliptic points to different stars on the circle at different times; The Earth’s axis points to different stars on the circle at different times + 1;3;4;5;7

Tick all that apply. + The Sun was bigger back then; The angular size of the Sun was incorrectly determined; He made an error in his calculations; Unaided observation of the Sun is difficult and dangerous; He confused the Sun with another bright star + 2;4
