Define libration in longitude. Tick all that apply. + cb + The Sun pulls on the Moon; As the Moon orbits the Earth it changes speed; It is slowest at the perigee; The change in speed causes the Moon to rock slightly; Thus we can see further round the East and West sides; Thus we can see further round the Poles + 2;4;5
Define libration in latitude. Tick all that apply + cb + The Moon is inclined 6.5 degrees to the perpendicular of its orbit; The Moon rocks back and forth on its axis; The Moon alternately presents its poles to the Earth in its orbit; Thus we can see further round the East and West sides; Thus we can see further round the Poles + 1;3;5
The apparent path of the Moon is inclined at how many degrees to the Ecliptic? + wn + 5
The declination of the Moon can vary by how many degrees? + ww + 28.5
How many nodes does the Moon have? + wn + 2
What does the following statement describe? "The orientation of the Moon's orbit changes with time, so that each time the Moon crosses the Ecliptic it does do a little further back along it". + rb + Libration; Regression of the Moon's nodes; Lunar Eclipse; Transit + 2
How long does it take for the Moon's nodes to return to their original position in years (to 1 d.p.)? + ww + 18.6
Which side of the Moon has more 'Seas'? + rb + Near side; Far side + 1
"This is the line that divides the visible part of the Moon from the dark parts. Craters on this line are more obvious". This statement describes the... + ww + terminator
Tick all of the statements about the far side of the Moon that are correct. + cb + It was first seen by Soviet probe Luna 3; It was first seen by American probe Luna 3; It was first seen in 1950; It was first seen in 1959 + 1;4
What evidence is there to support the Giant Impact Hypothesis? Tick all that apply. + cb + Moon is smaller than Earth; Moon has craters; Same abundancies of Oxygen isotopes as on Earth; No volatile substance on the Moon; KREEP rocks on the Moon + 3;4;5
Which Moon creation theory does the following statement describe? "The Moon was similar to a wandering asteroid and was captured by the Earth's gravity". + rb + Capture Theory; Accretion Theory; Giant Impact Hypothesis + 1
Which Moon creation theory does the following statement describe? "The Moon formed at a similar time to the Earth from a cloud of dust". + rb + Capture Theory; Accretion Theory; Giant Impact Hypothesis + 2
Which Moon creation theory does the following statement describe? "A Mars sized object collided with the young Earth, ejecting material. This material condensed to form the Earth". + rb + Capture Theory; Accretion Theory; Giant Impact Hypothesis + 3
After the Apollo missions, which Moon creation theory was, and is, most widely accepted? + rb + Capture Theory; Accretion Theory; Giant Impact Hyposthesis + 3
A 'Blood Moon' is a the result of what type of Eclipse? + rb + Solar Eclipse; Annular Eclipse; Inferior Eclipse; Lunar Eclipse + 4
Tick all of the statements about Lunar Eclipses that are correct. + cb + The Moon cannot be seen; The Moon appears a dark coppery colour; They occur every month; The Earth is in the middle; Half a hemisphere can see it at a time; The Earth appears as a dark disc with a red halo from the Moon + 2;4;5;6
Tick all of the statements about Solar Eclipses that are correct. + cb + Can only be seen for a short period of time on a narrow band; The Sun is covered by the Moon's disc; The Sun is in the middle; The sky becomes darker; The Moon appears red + 1;2;4
When the Moon's shadow doesn't reach the Earth during an Eclipse, the Moon appears to encircled in an... + ww + annulus
What is the only part of the Sun that can be seen during a Total Solar Eclipse? + ww + corona
Tick all of the statements that are correct + cb + Partial Solar Eclipses can be seen for longer than Total Solar Eclipses; Total Solar Eclipses can be seen from a wider track than Partial Solar Eclipses; The change in brightness is more noticeable for Partial Solar Eclipses + 1
Why don't Eclipses occur every Lunar Cycle? + rb + They do; The Moon, Sun and Earth are in different planes; The Earth and Moon move further from and closer to the Sun in their orbit; The Sun changes size and brightness every 11 years + 2
Tick all of the statements about the Lunar Map that are correct. + img +moonmap-min.jpg+ cb + A is Sea of Tranquility; B is Sea of Serenity; C is Crater Tycho; D is the Appenine Mountains; E is the Cold Sea; F is Crater Coppernicus; G is Sea of Crises + 3;4;7
