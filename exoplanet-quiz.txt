Which method of discovering an Exoplanet does the following statement describe? "A massive Exoplanet pulls its star with gravity, causing it to wobble. By carefully measuring the position of the star this wobble can be detected". + rb + Astrometry; Transit Method; Radial Velocity Method + 1
Which method of discovering an Exoplanet does the following statement describe? "A massive Exoplanet causes a very slight drop in its star's brightness when transiting". + rb + Astrometry; Transit Method; Radial Velocity Method + 2
Which method of discovering an Exoplanet does the following statement describe? "A massive Exoplanet pulls its star, causing it to wobble, red- and blue-shifting its light. Spectroscopy can detect these oscillations in wavelength". + rb + Astrometry; Transit Method; Radial Velocity Method + 3
Which method of discovering Exoplanets is the most sucessful? + rb + Astrometry; Transit Method; Radial Velocity Method + 3
Why have no Earth-sized Exoplanets been discovered? + rb + No other Earth-sized planets; They have too small an effect on their star to be noticed; They are obscured by larger Exoplanets nearby + 2
