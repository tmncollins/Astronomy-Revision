Tick all of the statements about star formation that are correct. + cb + Nebulae are formed from the gravitational collapse of dust and gas; Most Nebulae are located in the centre of the galaxy; As Nebulae collapse they condense into single giant stars called Protostars; As Nebulae collapse they break into smaller clouds called Protostars; After a thousand years, the giant Protostars split into smaller stars + 1;4
Nebulae that are very hot and emit light at different wavelengths are known as... + ww + emission
Nebulae that are cold and very dense obscure the light coming from stars behind them. They are observed as a dark cloud of dust and are known as... + ww + absorption
A cluster of stars that are all similar ages and originate from the same dust cloud is called an... + ww + open

Tick all of the statements about Supernovae that are correct. + cb + All stars go Supernova when they die; A Supernova is made of the ejected high-speed superhot gases from a dead star; Heavy elements such as gold fuse in a Supernova + 2;3
Tick all of the statements about Planetary Nebulae that are correct. + cb + They are the birth place of Exoplanets; They are a form of Emission Nebulae; They are made of Carbon, Oxygen and Nitrogen gases; They are formed from the outer shells of dead stars + 2;3;4
